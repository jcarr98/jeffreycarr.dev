# About the website
This webiste was made in my freetime as a project to enhance my web app development skills. I have previously worked with various frameworks including React and AngularJS. I wanted this website to be a test of my ability to create a functioning and fashionable website without the help of any frameworks (including CSS frameworks). All of the code is my own except for imported fonts and icons.

# React site
This pure HTML/JS/CSS site replaced my previous site that was made using React. You can view the React version of this site by reviewing previous versions of the master branch.
